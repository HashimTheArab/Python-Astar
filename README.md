# Python-Astar
A path finding program using the A* algorithm and randomly generated mazes. This is unfinished but partially works. 

This is my first "real" python program and first time trying to use an algorithm like this.

To use this install the cmu_graphics library at https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop and place the decompressed folder in the same path as the program.
